1. I have spent approximately 3 hours on this coding assignment. If I had more time, I would have - 
	a. Improved error handling
	b. Enhance logging for better debugging and monitoring
2. I have been battling with escape sequences for years. Every time we need a newline or a quote in the string, 
    it’s like going through a maze of backslashes. But then, C# 11 has "raw string literals", and it’s like a superhero to save the day!
    Did not use this feature in this project as there are no multi line strings.
3. Yes, I have troubleshot performance issues in production before. My main checklist includes:
    a.Reproducing the issue in a controlled environment.
    b.Checking application logs for errors, slow queries, or API response times.
    c.Database optimization by analyzing slow SQL queries with SQL Profiler and Execution Plans. 
      In Exact, we have a dedicated DB admin team that helps us with analyzing any DB related issues
4. The latest technical book I am reading is “c#q3 and .Net 9” by Mark J.Price. Some keythings I have learned so far are:
    a. New C#13 features like improved pattern matching, collection expressions.
    b. Modern best practices in C#, including clean architecture principles
5. I felt this assignment is closer to the real-world development. I enjoyed working on this assignment.
